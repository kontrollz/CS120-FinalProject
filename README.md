# CS120 Final Project

## Project Proposal

We plan on creating a **weather forecast app for astronomy** using the [7Timer API](https://www.7timer.info/doc.php?lang=en). This API provides meteorological services important to astronomers, such as:

- **Cloud cover**  
- **Astronomical seeing** (air turbulence affecting observation)  
- **Atmospheric transparency**

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a **unique, astronomy-focused weather experience**.  
- Personalized interface where users can:
  - Select favorite locations
  - Choose the most important weather metrics to display  
- Use a SQL database to manage user accounts (logins, passwords, preferences)  
- Present all relevant information in a clear and easy-to-view display

---

## Motivation

There is currently a lack of astronomically-relevant weather apps designed for amateur astronomers. This app aims to fill that gap while creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
